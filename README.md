H0melab Downloader is a browser-based media downloader maintained by [DasEric](https://github.com/DasEric). It combines multiple supported catalogue sites, a persistent download queue, a library, Auto-Sync, Discord requests, and a TMDB-backed availability watchlist in one responsive Web UI.

> This project is a continuation of the original **AniWorld Downloader** by [Phoenixthrush](https://github.com/phoenixthrush/AniWorld-Downloader) and its contributors. The provider integrations and a substantial part of the downloader core originate from that project. H0melab Downloader keeps that attribution while providing a new product identity and browser-only workflow.

## Highlights

- Responsive Web UI with desktop sidebar and mobile drawer
- Film, series, anime, manga, and library workflows
- Persistent queue with total and current-episode progress
- Configurable parallel HLS transfer count
- Auto-Sync for explicitly selected series
- TMDB availability watchlist for upcoming **and already released** films or series
- Strict automatic matching: direct TMDB identity or exact title and year
- Configurable availability checks from once daily to hourly
- Optional local login, OIDC SSO, API keys, and Discord request bot
- Docker-first deployment with a non-root runtime user

## Requirements

- Docker with Docker Compose (recommended), or Python 3.11 or newer
- FFmpeg for downloading and combining media streams
- A modern browser for the Web UI
- Optional: a TMDB API key for the availability watchlist

## Supported catalogues

| Catalogue | Content | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AniWorld | Anime and anime films | Enabled |
| SerienStream | Series | Enabled |
| MegaKino | Films and series | Enabled |
| FilmPalast / Filmo | Films | Enabled |
| MangaFire | Manga | Enabled |
| Moflix | Films and series | Enabled |
| Cineby | Films and series | Disabled |
| Kinox | Films and series | Disabled |
| BurningSeries | Series | Disabled |
| Hanime | Adult animation | Disabled |

Every catalogue can be enabled or disabled under **Settings**. Availability, captcha requirements and individual stream providers can change independently of this project.

## Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DasEric/H0melab-Downloader-V2.git
cd H0melab-Downloader-V2
mkdir -p Downloads
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

The included Compose file deliberately keeps the old `aniworld-data` Docker volume name. Existing installations therefore retain their users, API keys, queue, watchlist, themes, secrets, and settings when they pull v2 and recreate the container.

Useful operating commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
```

To build the image from the checked-out source, replace `image:` in `docker-compose.yaml` with `build: .` and run `docker compose up -d --build`.

## Upgrade from v5

The first v2 start performs a non-destructive migration:

1. `~/.aniworld` is copied to `~/.h0melab-downloader` when the new directory does not exist.
2. The SQLite database is copied with SQLite's backup API to `h0melab.db`; the original `aniworld.db` remains as a rollback copy.
3. Existing movie watchlist rows are copied into the new film-and-series schema with their IDs and queue links intact.
4. Existing `ANIWORLD_*` values are mapped to `H0MELAB_*`; v2 names win when both are present.
5. Unknown/custom `.env` entries are preserved.
6. `.web-settings.env`, authentication secrets, themes, browser profile, downloads, custom paths, Auto-Sync state, and Discord settings remain in the persistent data directory.

Back up the persistent volume before any production upgrade. Do not delete the old data directory or volume until the migrated instance has been verified.

## Configuration

Settings can be changed in the browser. A fully documented template is available at [`src/h0melab/.env.example`](src/h0melab/.env.example).

Frequently used variables:

```dotenv
H0MELAB_DOWNLOAD_PATH=Downloads
H0MELAB_UI_LANGUAGE=de
H0MELAB_HLS_CONCURRENCY=8
H0MELAB_TMDB_API_KEY=
H0MELAB_UPCOMING_CHECKS_PER_DAY=1
H0MELAB_WEB_AUTH=0
```

`H0MELAB_HLS_CONCURRENCY` is read when the next episode begins. Changing it never modifies an episode that is already running.

## Availability watchlist

1. Add a TMDB API key under **Settings → Integrations**.
2. Choose how many checks should run per day (1–24).
3. Open **Demnächst**, search for a film or series, and add it.
4. The scheduler searches every enabled compatible site after the release date, or immediately for already released and unknown-date titles.
5. Only an exact title/year match or direct TMDB match is queued. Ambiguous matches stay on the list.

## Theming

Administrators can import or edit a theme under **Settings → Appearance**. The shipped [`themes/template.css`](themes/template.css) documents every supported token and surface; [`themes/light.css`](themes/light.css) is a complete example. Store remote styles on a host that serves CSS with the correct content type.

## Optional integrations

OIDC SSO, the Discord request bot, API keys, custom output paths, and custom themes are optional. Enable only the integrations used by your deployment and keep all associated secrets in the persistent settings volume.

## API

The Web UI uses the JSON API exposed by the same service. Administrators can create scoped API keys under **Settings → API keys**. Send a key using the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: h0d_yourkey" http://localhost:8080/api/queue
```

Available scopes are read-only, download access and administrator access. API keys never expose stored TMDB, Discord or OIDC secrets. The current endpoint list and examples are shown directly on the settings page so they match the installed version.

## Updating

```bash
git pull --rebase
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

For a source installation, activate the virtual environment and run `pip install -e ".[all,test]"` again after updating. Keep a backup of the persistent configuration directory or Docker volume before a major-version upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

- Check `docker compose logs -f` or the terminal output first.
- Verify that the download directory is writable by the container or service account.
- Confirm that FFmpeg is installed when running without Docker.
- If a custom theme hides controls, open `/settings?nocss=1` and remove the theme.
- If a catalogue requires a captcha, configure its browser/captcha options under **Settings**.
- A title on the availability watchlist is queued only after the configured language and a usable provider are available.

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[all,test]"
h0melab-downloader
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

## Security

- Run the service only on a trusted network or enable authentication.
- Put public deployments behind HTTPS and set `H0MELAB_WEB_BASE_URL`.
- TMDB, Discord, and OIDC secrets are masked by the API and excluded from settings exports.
- JSON write endpoints reject non-JSON bodies; authenticated deployments use secure session settings and CSRF protection for browser forms.
- The Docker image runs as an unprivileged user.
